## Installation

### Install Directly

You can install the released version of readflexfile from
[TRAN](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/home/) with:

``` r
install.packages("readflexfile", repos = "http://shiny.technomics.net/tran")
```

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository into a working directory of your choice. The most
simple way is to use
[`rnomics`](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/docs/rnomics/).

``` r
rnomics::gitlab_clone("NA", "your/file/directory/here")
```

Otherwise using the following method.

1.  Navigate to the directory with terminal using the `cd` command to
    where you would like to clone the repository too. The project will
    become a sub-directory of this location.
      - `cd "your/file/directory/here"`
2.  Clone the desired repository from GitLab. Use the option to not
    check for the valid certificate (note the double hyphen in front of
    config).
      - `git clone --config http.sslVerify=false
        https://192.168.10.152/costverse/readflexfile.git`
