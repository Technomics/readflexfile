## Installation

### Install Directly

You can install the released version of readflexfile from [TRAN](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/home/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readflexfile", repos = "http://shiny.technomics.net/tran")
```

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository into a working directory of your choice. The most simple way is to use [`rnomics`](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/docs/rnomics/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
rnomics::gitlab_clone("NA", "your/file/directory/here")
```

Otherwise using the following method.

1. Navigate to the directory with terminal using the `cd` command to where you would like to clone the repository too. The project will become a sub-directory of this location.
    - `cd "your/file/directory/here"`

2. Clone the desired repository from GitLab. Use the option to not check for the valid certificate (note the double hyphen in front of config).
    - `git clone --config http.sslVerify=false https://192.168.10.152/costverse/readflexfile.git`

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(readflexfile)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
