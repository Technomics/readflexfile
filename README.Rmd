The goal of readflexfile is to facilitate the reading of the FlexFile from the original JSON format into R. The package also includes helpful functions to flatten the schema into a single table.

View the [package site](https://technomics.github.io/readflexfile) to explore the features!

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please use the [issue board](https://github.com/Technomics/readflexfile/issues).

## Welcome to the costverse!

The *costverse* is a collection of R packages, inspired by the *tidyverse*. The goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem of R packages to streamline tasks encountered by analysts in the cost analysis profession. This can range from importing common data formats, working with difficult data structures (e.g., a WBS), or applying more advanced analytical techniques!

The *costverse* began as an internal [Technomics](https://www.technomics.net/) project to develop a set of tools that enable our employee owners to solve our clientsâ€™ problems more effectively. While aspects of the project remain internal, the following packages are currently available to the public. You are free to use them under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) - all that we ask is to please cite us as the authors.

 - [costmisc](https://github.com/Technomics/costmisc/)
 - [readflexfile](https://github.com/Technomics/readflexfile/)
 - [flexample](https://github.com/Technomics/flexample/)
 
Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about what else is in the works!

## Installation

You can download and install directly from our GitHub repository. If this does not work or does not have a build for your version of R, try using `install_github()` instead (see Development version instructions).

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexample", repos = "https://technomics.github.io/repo/")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix, or to use a feature from the development version, you can install readflexfile using the following. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::dev_mode(on = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("Technomics/readflexfile")
```
